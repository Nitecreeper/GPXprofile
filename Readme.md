This app graphs the path in a map, the classic 2D profile and a 3D profile from a GPX file, every section has a color that represent the percentage of the slope and shows other significant data for cyclist. This app was developed for climbs but can be used for every type of ride if it has a GPX file with latitude, longitude and elevation data.
